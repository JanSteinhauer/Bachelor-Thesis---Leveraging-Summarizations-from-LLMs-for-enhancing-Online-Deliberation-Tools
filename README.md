## Overview:
This thesis explores the application of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to enhance **online community deliberation** through various summarization techniques. The study focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of different summarization methods on digital platforms, with the goal of improving user experience and interaction in large-scale, online deliberations.

## Thesis Title:
**Leveraging Summarizations from LLMs for Enhancing Community Online Deliberation Tools**

## Objective:
The main objective of this thesis is to identify and analyze the best summarization techniques for summarizing discussions on digital community deliberation tools, specifically using the **Polis** platform. The thesis aims to:
- Investigate how summarization can improve the quality of online deliberations.
- Test user preferences and interaction with different LLM-generated summaries.

## Key Summarization Techniques Explored:
1. **Summary with Citation**: Summaries that provide scientific citations for credibility and further reading.
2. **Simple Language Summary**: Summaries written in language that is easy to understand, aimed at younger audiences (e.g., 16-year-olds).
3. **Participant-Initiated Summary**: Summaries that are initiated by user interaction.
4. **Tree-Structured Summary**: Interactive summaries allowing users to explore subtopics by diving deeper into key themes.
5. **Graph Summary**: Summarizing graphical data from discussions on platforms like Polis.
6. **Ability to Chat**: Summaries with an interactive chat feature that allows users to ask follow-up questions and explore the discussion further.

## Methodology:
A within-subject design experiment was conducted using the **Polis** platform. The study included six different summarization techniques, and participants evaluated their preferences and user experience through:
- **Qualitative Data**: Collected using the Thinking-Aloud method.
- **Quantitative Data**: Collected through a modified System Usability Scale (SUS).

## Findings:
The results indicate that participants generally preferred summaries that included citations and tree-structured summaries for their interactive depth and credibility. The ability to chat was also well-received, although concerns about the reliability of LLM-generated responses were raised.

## Future Work:
The thesis suggests future research to:
- Combine citation features with tree-structured summaries.
- Explore further refinement of graph summaries.
- Conduct studies on the impact of simple language summaries for various age groups.
